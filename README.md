## Introduction 

SuPReMo implements the unified motion modelling and image registation 
framework as proposed by [Jamie McClelland et al.](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/aa6070) and 
was developed by the Radiotherapy Image Computing Group at the Centre for Medical Image Computing, 
University College London, UK. 

The source code if available on [github](https://github.com/UCL/SuPReMo) and the [documentation](https://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/SuPReMo/) is
