# SuPReMo - Surrogate Parametrised Respiratory Motion Modelling    {#mainpage}

Current travis build status  of main branch (Linux build and documentation): [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/UCL/SuPReMo.svg?token=ryYEyvSMfhuCX4W6bRRD&branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/UCL/SuPReMo)

## Introduction 

SuPReMo implements the unified motion modelling and image registration 
framework as proposed by [Jamie McClelland et al.](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/aa6070) and 
was developed by Bjoern Eiben  and the Radiotherapy Image Computing Group at the Centre for Medical Image Computing, University College London, UK. The publication describing the background of this software package in the context of a multi-slice image acquisition designed for an MR-Linac workflow can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/ad222f). 

The source code is available on [github](https://github.com/UCL/SuPReMo) and the [documentation](https://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/SuPReMo/) is hosted on the corresponding github-pages.

## Getting started

Below is a list of additional pages that will help you to get started with SuPReMo. These links will get you to the correspomding pages
of the [documentation](https://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/SuPReMo/). 


* For information on how to build your own version and to get started with SuPReMo 
see [getting started with SuPReMo](https://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/SuPReMo/gettingstarted.html).
* For an in-depth background  see [the background section](https://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/SuPReMo/background.html). 
* If you have used the previous implementation of the generalised framework called *nifty-reg-resp*, 
then you will find [information on how to make the transition here](https://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/SuPReMo/transitionfromregresp.html).
