## Introduction 

SuPReMo implements the unified motion modelling and image registation 
framework as proposed by [Jamie McClelland et al.](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6560/aa6070) and 
was developed by Bjoern Eiben  and the Radiotherapy Image Computing Group at the Centre for Medical Image Computing, 
University College London, UK. 

The source code is available on [github](https://github.com/UCL/SuPReMo) and the [documentation](https://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/SuPReMo/) is 
hosted on the corresponding github-pages.

## Getting started

Below is a list of additional pages that will help you to get started with SuPReMo. These links will get you to the correspomding pages
of the documentation. 


* For more information on how to build your own version and to get started with SuPReMo 
see [getting started with SuPReMo](https://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/SuPReMo/gettingstarted.html).
* For an in-depth background  see [the background section](https://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/SuPReMo/background.html). 
* If you have used the previous implementation of the generalised framework called *nifty-reg-resp*, 
then you will find [information on how to make the transition here](https://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/SuPReMo/transitionfromregresp.html).
